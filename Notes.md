# Data Notes

SQL databases behave less like object collections the more size and performance matter;
object collections behave less like tables and rows the more abstractions start to matter.

The `database` is a `relational algebra engine`.   

Units can be composed into larger structures.

All processes are fully exposed within a series of composable, transparent tools.

# Citus Extension
